            <article>
                <p>Hey! Let me tell you something about myself. So, on November 19 in 1994, I became part of this world.
                    I was born in the small and old town of Doesburg. Doesburg is located in the east of the Netherlands
                    in the province of Gelderland.
                    My dream has always been to live in Amsterdam and since January of 2022 this dream has become
                    reality. Now I live in the beautiful city of Amsterdam and have the privilege of doing the amazing
                    study Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD), where I'm in my third year and working hard on my
                    minor. I started this study at the HAN in Arnhem in 2020,
                    but after 1 year I found out that what I wanted to learn better fits the programme of the CMD study
                    at the HVA. So, since my second year I am a CMD student at the HVA. Before I started my CMD study I
                    did finish two other studies. First, I studied to be a waitress with some floor manager skills. For
                    my second study I did Marketing & Communication. I really enjoyed my Marketing & Communication
                    study, but I thought it was important to gain more knowledge and to study at an HBO level.
                    Next to my study now, I work at the restaurant Loetje Zuidas as a waitress. In this job I really
                    enjoy socializing with the guests and having a strong team bond with my colleagues.
                    In my free time I really love to go for a walk and enjoy to impressions of the city or the peaceful
                    nature. Next to that I really love to go to a good restaurant with my friends and family, but an
                    evening alone with a wonderful Netflix series also makes me very happy.

                <p>In this two and a half year as a CMD student I was able to learn many new things. Last year I really
                    focused on getting basic skills as a web developer, but this year I really want to focus on getting
                    great skills as a UX/UI designer. That is why my learning goals are focussed on getting better as a
                    UX/UI designer. Skills I want to work on as a UX/UI designer are for example developing user flows,
                    prototypes and wireframes or doing user testing. </p>
