            <article>
                <p>Hi there! Let me tell you a bit about myself. On November 19, 1994, I was Born in the charming,
                    historic town of Doesburg in the east of the Netherlands. Since January 2022, I've got my own place
                    in Amsterdam, where I'm fully immersed in my Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD) studies at the
                    Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HVA).

                    <br>
                    <br>After starting my degree at the HAN University of Applied Sciences (HAN) in Arnhem, I realized
                    that
                    the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences offered a more tailored program for my interests. So, I
                    made the move to Amsterdam and am now in my final year of this exciting program.
                    Before diving into the world of design, I explored other paths. I first trained as a waitress and
                    gained some experience in floor management. Then, I delved into Marketing & Communication. While I
                    enjoyed my marketing studies, I felt the need to deepen my knowledge and pursue a higher education
                    level.

                    <br>
                    <br>Balancing my studies with a job as a waitress at Loetje Zuidas, I've developed strong
                    interpersonal
                    skills and a passion for creating positive experiences for others. In my free time, I love exploring
                    the vibrant city of Amsterdam, finding peace in nature, and connecting with friends and family over
                    good food and great company. Of course, there's nothing quite like curling up with a good Netflix
                    series for some much-needed relaxation.

        <h2 class="aboutmetext">LEARNING GOALS</h2>
        <section class="box">
            <article>
                <p>As a CMD student, I've had the opportunity to learn a great deal and develop my skills
                    over the past few years. I've explored various directions within the program, including
                    development, UI design, and UX design. I have concluded that UX design suits me the best
                    and brings me the most enjoyment. Additionally, I've realized that I get a lot of energy
                    from conducting research, which is why I'd like to delve deeper into UX research as well.
                    My focus now is to continue immersing myself in the work of a UX designer and to become
                    increasingly proficient in this field. </p>
