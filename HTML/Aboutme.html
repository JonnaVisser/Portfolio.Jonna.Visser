            <article>
                <p>Hey! Let me tell you something about myself. So, on November 19 in 1994, I became part of this world.
                    I was born in the small and old town of Doesburg. Doesburg is in the east of the Netherlands in the
                    province of Gelderland. My dream has always been to live in Amsterdam and since January of 2022 this
                    dream has become reality. Now I live in the beautiful city of Amsterdam and have the privilege of
                    doing the amazing study Communication & Multimedia Design (CMD). I started this study at the HAN in
                    Arnhem in 2020, but after 1 year I found out that what I wanted to learn better fits the programme
                    of the CMD study at the HVA. So, since my second year I am a CMD student at the HVA. Before I
                    started my CMD study I did finish two other studies. First, I studied to be a waitress with some
                    floor manager skills. For my second study I did Marketing & Communication. I really enjoyed my
                    Marketing & Communication study, but I thought it was important to gain more knowledge and to study
                    at an HBO level. Besides my studies I work at the restaurant Loetje Zuidas as a waitress. In this
                    job I really enjoy socializing with the guests and having a strong team bond with my colleagues. In
                    my free time I really love to go for a walk and enjoy to impressions of the city or the peaceful
                    nature. Next to that I really love to go to a good restaurant with my friends and family, but an
                    evening alone with a wonderful Netflix series also makes me very happy.

            <article>
                <p>Over the past 3 years as a CMD student I have been able to learn a lot and work on my skills. I have
                    invested my time in discovering which direction I want to take with this study and where my passion
                    lies. This is why in my second year I focused entirely on web development and last year I focused on
                    UX/UI design. After these two years I discovered that my passion lies in user experience design.
                    That is why I want to delve further into UX design. So, the focus of my learning goals lies in
                    understanding the process you will take as a UX designer. </p>
