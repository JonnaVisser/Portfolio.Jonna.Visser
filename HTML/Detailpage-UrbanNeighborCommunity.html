                <h2>assignment</h2>
                <p>In this assignment I worked on a case for the National Library where I had to come up with a solution
                    for the project Engaging Citizens. It was important for the assignment to make a prototype of the
                    solution I will come to with the process of a user experience designer.
                    For several years now, National libraries have been experimenting with citizens science (CS). This
                    experimentation started from a local perspective, takes place in different ways, and from different
                    starting points. One has more focus on providing residents with measuring equipment while the other
                    offers a platform function for citizen who are starting their own research. Everyone follows a
                    unique approach in collaboration with various local partners. The goal is to connect with residents,
                    which can be difficult.
                    I came up with an app that will help in this process. The name of the app is Urban Neighbor
                    Community.
                </p>
                <h2>process</h2>
                <p>Another team already started this case and that is why I started with a lot of information of their
                    research. I started this process with framing the case. I looked through the information from the
                    DSS team (the first that worked on the case) and added some own research with some interviews.
                    With this information I was able to come up with a solution for engaging citizens. I build this
                    solution in a way of storytelling. With this storytelling the next designer could work this more
                    through, but I will focus on my prototype that will be an app. this part is the biggest part of the
                    solution. The way the whole solution will work out is something I visualized and described in the
                    costumer journey.
                    In the design process it was important to have different iteration to become to the right prototype
                    for the app. the app is focussing on collecting data in an environment of a social media concept. In
                    this way the target group is interested in participating. In the research I said something about the
                    top-down and bottom-up approach that can both be important in this project. That is why I put both
                    ways in my prototype. With the possibility to create a whole new community I can add the other
                    approach. I carefully looked at all the Insights I had out of research, feedback, and testing and
                    added this to the prototype.
                </p>
